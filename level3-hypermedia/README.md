# Richardson Maturity Model Examples

Example services showing the 4 levels of the Richardson Maturity Model for REST services.  

To try them out:

1. cd into the directory for the level you want to try
2. mvn install liberty:run
3. got to the .../openapi/ui endpoint and use it to send requests to the services.

For levels 0 and 1, only a small number of methods are implemented, for example "getAccount".  See the code for what might be valid.
